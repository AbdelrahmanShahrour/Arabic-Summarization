# Arabic Text Summarization

# 1 - Automatic text summarization
### 1.1 - Introduction
Over the beyond decades, the want to summarize files has routinely been regarded to boom because of the big mass of online texts consisting of news, scholarly articles, and so on. Assigning the summarization mission to a gadget has come to be a pressing want to extract and generate key statistics from the massive quantity of textual content available. Text summarization has been a place of excessive study for the beyond 50 years, specifically for generally used languages and comparatively easy grammar consisting of English. However, the Arabic language did now no longer get hold of an awful lot of interest because of its complexity grammatically and morphologically, etc. Arabic gives researchers and builders of the Natural Language Process (NLP) program enormous demanding situations because of its difficulties.

It is important to assess the effectiveness of the summaries generated via way of means of the gadget to decide the quantity of its reliability. There are methods, both human evaluation, that is, guide evaluation, which isn't a sensible approach withinside the case of big facts sets, or routinely the usage of the ROUGE metric, which is the only one that we undertake in this study.

## 1.2 - NLP
### 1.2.1 - Problem definition
We all know that machines cannot understand human languages such as speeches, texts, or even letters, so converting these texts into machine-understandable format has become a crucial goal to enable them to perform useful tasks. The domain of study that concentrates on enabling computers to intelligently process human languages is termed Natural Language Processing or NLP for short. It is a multi-speciality field that com- bines artificial intelligence, computing science, cognitive science, information processing, and linguistics. Natural language processing appeared to facilitate the work of the user and satisfy the desire to communicate with the computer in a natural language. 

NLP is divided into two parts:

Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG). 

1.2.1.1 - Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is the part of natural language processing that helps computers understand and interpret natural language as human beings do. It is used for machine translation, question answering, and many others. 

1.2.1.2 - Natural Language Generation (NLG) is a component of natural language processing, which is the process of creating meaningful text in the form of a natural language from an internal representation. It can be considered the opposite of natural language understanding. NLG systems offer an important role in text summarization, machine translation, and dialogue systems.

### 1.2.2 - Application of NLP
1.2.2.1 - Machine translation (MT): Natural language processing is at the heart of MT because it uses machines to automatically translate the natural language (from one language to another). The challenge of machine translation is not to translate word for word, but to use grammar and tense to preserve the true meaning of the sentence

1.2.2.2 - Question answering (QA): Question answering is one of the most important tasks in natural language processing (NLP), where a system takes a natural language question as input and returns a textual answer or answer paragraph.

1.2.2.3 - Sentiment Analysis (SA): The field of sentiment analysis also called opinion mining hasreceived a lot of focus from NLP. It is the field of analyzing peopleâ€™s opinions, sentiments, evaluations, and reviews to determine the positive or negative orientation of user-generated texts about entities such as products, services, and others.

1.2.2.4 - Summarization: It is the process of conveying the most important information from a source (or sources) to produce a condensed version. This task took advantage of the NLP to reformulate the generated summary into a more coherent text.
